# Fixes

- handle "unknown activity" (no duration text)
- handle activities lasting more than one day
- handle day overflow, when activities are on the next calendar day

# Requirements

- better presentation (a table, perhaps?)
- display something about scrobbles in multiactivity slots.
- make username configurable and store it in Chrome storage
- handle last fm errors (toast message?)

# Nice to have

- link to Last.fm library page with the proper filters
- time zones :s
- login: currently only works if the user's recent scrobbles are public
- handle more than 200 scrobbles
