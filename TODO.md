# Fixes

- handle "unknown activity" (no duration text)

# Requirements

- better presentation (a table, perhaps?)

# Nice to have

- display something about scrobbles in multiactivity slots.
- handle last fm errors
- indicate somehow if no user is set up
- link to Last.fm library page with the proper filters
- time zones :s
- login: currently only works if the user's recent scrobbles are public
- handle more than 200 scrobbles
